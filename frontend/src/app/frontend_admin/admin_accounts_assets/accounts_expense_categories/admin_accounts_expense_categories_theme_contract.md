# admin_accounting_expense_categories — Theme Contract

## Source-derived tokens
bg-warning-bg, border-2, border-primary, border-transparent, border-warning-bg, text-body, text-caption, text-danger, text-warning

## Responsive contract
- Preserve the existing responsive classes and breakpoints in the local component closure.
- Tables/data grids must retain their existing small-screen overflow or card-stack behavior; do not introduce horizontal page overflow.
- Keep translated strings able to wrap; no fixed-width assumptions are added by this move.

## Accessibility contract
- Preserve programmatic labels, keyboard navigation, focus restoration, accessible status/error messages, and reduced-motion safeguards present in the source.
- Color must not be the sole indicator of state.

## Host theme boundary
- Use the shared semantic design tokens already consumed by this source. Do not invent colors, raw hex values, or new token names.
